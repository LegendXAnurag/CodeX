#ML Task 1 : Make an ML model to help him plot a graph given force and acceleration incoordinates and thus find the best fit for the mass.
  The task requires us to estimate mass when a set of acceleration and corresponding forces are given.
  I have used Python's Linear Regression Model of scikit-learn (or sklearn) library to accomplish the task.
  To run the project, download the MLTask1.py and randomdata.py in a folder(both should be on the same folder) and then run the MLTask1.py file.
  In MLTask1.py, there is a variable named numPoint which corresponds to the number of force acceleration pairs to generate, it can be changed to produce the desired number of data pairs.
  I have used the numpy.random.seed(0) function, so that the each time the program is executed, the same set of sample force acceleration pairs are used.
  Output Screenshot named MLTask1.png is also present in the repository
